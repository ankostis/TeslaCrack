This tool mainly decrypts files from **TeslaCrypt ransomware** < v3.x
(see `TeslaCrypt versions`_, at the bottom).
These versions can be recognized from the extensions ``.vvv, .ccc,  .zzz, .aaa, .abc``
added to the names of you original files, and/or the filenames of the ransom notes
being ``Howto_RESTORE_FILES.txt``.

The tool should may help also ancient versions by reconstructing the *Bitcoin private-key*,
which is utilized by |TeslaDecrypt|_ or |TeslaDecoder|_ external programs.

Quickstart
==========

- The main entry-point of the tool is the ``teslacrack`` console-command::

    ## Install it.
    > pip install teslacrack

    ## Check how many different AES key(s) have encrypted your files:
    > teslacrack ls D:\some\infected\folder

    ## Factorize  AES or BTC "mul" keys reported by the command above
    ## in case not all factors existed in http://factordb.com/.
    > msieve -e 0xAD34AD2A32F4EE2...

    ## Guess your AES key from a "known" file-type:
    > teslacrack unfactor D:\some\infected\folder\foo.pdf

    ## OR use ONE of the commands below on rour "master" BTC key:
    #
    > teslacrack unfactor -ecdh D:\some\infected\folder\any.file
    > teslacrack unfactor -btc D:\some\infected\folder\any.file
    > teslacrack unfactor -btc-addr <your-addr> D:\some\infected\folder\any.file

    ## Edit `Add it into teslacrypt/decrypt.py` file and add
    ##  the key reported above into `known_AES_key_pairs` dict.

    ## Now decrypt all your hard-drive:
    > teslacrack decrypt --progress D:\

  .. Tip::

    To open a ``cmd.exe`` console, press ``[WinKey + R]`` and type ``cmd + [Enter]``
    When issuing commands describe here, skip the ``>`` char or the ``##`` lines.

- More detailed instructions are given in the `How to decrypt your files`_ section.

- More sub-commands are available - to receive their usage description, type::

    > teslacrack --help
    TeslaCrack - decryptor for the TeslaCrypt ransomware.

    USAGE:
        teslacrack ls        [options] [--fld=<field>...] [<path>...]
        teslacrack decrypt   [options] [--fld=<field>...]
                                    [--dry-run] [--delete | --delete-old]
                                    [(--fix | --overwrite) [--backup=<.ext>]] [<path>...]
        teslacrack unfactor  [options] [--ecdh | --btc-addr=<addr>] <file> <prime-factor>...
        teslacrack unfactor  [options] (--pub=<db-key> | --btc-addr=<addr>) <mul-db-key> [<prime-factor>...]
        teslacrack key       [options] [--force] [--delete] [--batch]
                                    [--btc | --aes | --master=<db-key>]
                                    [--fld=<field-n-value>]... [<db-key>...]
        teslacrack -h | --help
        teslacrack -V | --version

    SUB-COMMANDS:
        ls:
            Lists header-fields (keys and their status) from tesla-files in <path> file(s)/folder(s).
            If any unknown keys encountered, searches them in http://factordb.com (unless --no-factordb given).
            Use -C <conv> option to control the formatting of the fields. Use --fld <field> to limit
            what is listed.  If no <path> given, it lists recursively current folder.
        decrypt:
            Decrypts tesla-file(s) in <path> file(s)/folder(s) if their private AES or BTC keys
            already known; behaves like `ls` if any unknown keys encountered; additionally,
            if key fully factored, attempts to unfactor it.
            If no <path> given, it decrypts recursively current folder.
        unfactor (1st form):
           Attempts to reconstruct prv-keys from file on a best effort basis:
           if <prime-factor>s given, they choose which key to attack; otherwise, it reconstructs
           anyone of *BTC* or *AES* prv-key (in that order) with all primes known either
           in the http://factordb.com or in the internal key-db (i.e. set by `ls` or `key` sub-cmds).
           When none of --ecdh or --btc-addr specified, the default method is used,
           so the <file> must belong to `known_file_magic`.
        unfactor (2nd form):
            Like the `unfactor`, above, but the <mul-db-key> is explicitly given and
            the method must be one of *ECDH* or *BTC*.  Use the `ls` or `decrypt` sub-cmds
            to print unknown "mul" keys; factorize them to get all <prime-factor>.
        key:
            List or update the internal key-db at `~/.teslacrack.yaml`.
            Without any --fld, --btc, --aes, --master options, it lists matching  <db-key> record(s)
            or all if non given; Otherwise, it creates new or updates matching key-records
            based on whether <db-key> given.

    OPTIONS:
        --pub [<pub-key>]      Reconstruct key based on Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography which:
                                 - can recover both AES or BTC[1] keys;
                                 - can recover keys from any file-type (no need for *magic-bytes*);
                                 - yields always a single correct key.
                               For the 1st form of `unfactor` sub-cmd, the <prime-factors> select which key
                               to crack (AES or BTC). For the 2nd form of `unfactor` sub-cmd, specify
                               which <mul-key> and paired <pub-key> to break.
        --btc-addr <btc-addr>  Guess BTC key based on the bitcoin-address and BTC[1] pub-key.
                               The <btc-addr> is typically found in the ransom-note or recovery file
        --fld=<field>          Any case-insenstive subs-string of tesla-file header-fields.
        -C=<conv>             Specify the print-out format for keys.
                               where <conv> is any non-ambiguous case-insensitive *prefix* from:
                                 - raw: all bytes as-is - no conversion (i.e. hex mul-keys NOT strip & l-rotate).
                                 - fix: like 'raw', but mul-keys fixed and size:int; fail if mul-keys invalid.
                                 - bin: all bytes (even mul-keys), mul-keys: fixed.
                                 - xhex: all string-HEX, size:bytes-hexed.
                                 - hex: all string-hex prefixed with '0x', size: int-hexed.
                                 - num: all natural numbers, size: int.
                                 - asc: all base64, size(int) - most concise.
                               [default: hex]
        --no-factordb          Do not search for prime-factors in http://factordb.com.
        --keydb-no-write       Do not update internal key-db at `~/.teslacrack.yaml`.
        --keydb-no-rw          Do not update nor read internal key-db `~/.teslacrack.yaml`.
        -b, --batch            Allow performing `key` subcmd operations on multiple matching keys.
        -f, --force            Force key-db operation, ie overwrite/move keys, delete keyrecs.
        -d, --delete           Delete key-records, or crypted-files after decrypting them.
        --delete-old           Delete crypted even if decrypted-file created during a previous run
                               [default: False].
        -n, --dry-run          Decrypt but don't Write/Delete files, just report actions performed
                               [default: False].
        --progress             Before start decrypting files, pre-scan all dirs, to
                               provide progress-indicator [default: False].
        --fix                  Re-decrypt tesla-files and overwrite crypted-counterparts if they have
                               unexpected size. If you enable it, by default it backs-up existing files
                               with '.BAK' extension (see `--backup`). Specify empty extension ''
                               for no backups (e.g. `--backup=`)
                               WARNING: You may LOOSE FILES that have changed due to
                               regular use, such as, configuration-files and mailboxes!
                               [default: False].
        --overwrite            Re-decrypt ALL tesla-files, overwritting all crypted-counterparts.
                               Optionally creates backups with the given extension (see `--backup`).
                               WARNING: You may LOOSE FILES that have changed due to
                               regular use, such as, configuration-files and mailboxes!
                               [default: False].
        --backup=<.ext>        Sets file-extension (with dot(`.`) included for backup-files
                               created by `--fix` and `--overwrite` options.
        -v, --verbose          Verbosely log(DEBUG) all actions performed.

    NOTES:
        - The <db-key> must match the prefix or name of some key registered in the internal key-db.
          Use the `key` or the `ls <file>` sub-cmds to register keys.
        - The (rough) pattern of usage is this:
            1. Run this cmd on some tesla-files to gather your mul-AES keys;
            2. factorize the mul-key(s) reported, first by searching http://factordb.com/
               and then use *msieve* or *YAFU* external programs to factorize
               any remaining non-prime ones;
            3. use `unfactor` sub-cmd to reconstruct your cleartext keys;
            4. add keys from above into `known_AES_key_pairs`, and then
            5. re-run `decrypt` on all infected file/directories.
        - For ancient versions of TeslaCrypt, use the private BTC-key  with *TeslaDecoder* external program.
        - Check the following for gathering required keys and addresses:

    EXAMPLES:

        teslacrack ls -v tesla-file.vvv             ## Decrypt file, and if unknwon key, printed.
        teslacrack unfactor tesla-file.vvv 1 3 5    ## Unfacrtor the AES-key of the file from primes 1,3,5.
        teslacrack decrypt .  bar\cob.xlsx          ## Decrypt current-folder & a file
        teslacrack decrypt --delete-old C:\\        ## WILL DELETE ALL `.vvv` files on disk!!!
        teslacrack decrypt                          ## Decrypt current-folder, logging verbosely.
        teslacrack decrypt --progress -n -v  C:\\   ## Just to check what actions will perform.

    Enjoy! ;)



Terminology
-----------
Elliptic Cryptography (EC):
    *TeslaCrypt* v2 applies a "amateurish" EC-sheme twice, first on the "Bitcoin" keys,
    and then on the "AES" ones.  During encryption/decryption, for both key-sets, a series of
    different key-types are generated, in the order that are described below.

    There is a nice overview of the `Elliptic Cryptography terms used throughout
    <http://andrea.corbellini.name/2015/05/30/elliptic-curve-cryptography-ecdh-and-ecdsa/>`_
    along with a `simple introduction into the EC "curves"
    <https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/>`_.
    It suffices to know that it is based on a "geometry" defined by "special" multiplications of
    *private-numbers* with x-y *public-points*;  contrary to the Euclidean geometry,
    when given a starting point and the multiplication result, it is infeasible(!)
    to derive the number factor.

EC *Private* Keys:
    These are the keys we try to reconstruct: one *BTC* and one or more *AES* keys.
    In addition to being *EC private numbers*, they have additional functionalities,
    explained below; but above all, they can decrypt directly or inderectly some (or all) files.
    They are not stored anywhere in your computer.

    Bitcoin Private key (other names: ``btc_prv``):
        It is generated during encryption, once per PC, and sent to cyber-criminals.
        It has 2 uses:

        1. It is the "master" EC *EC private number* able to derive all *AES session keys* that have
           encrypted your files.
        2. It makes the *private BTC address*, so if you had sent the money and you recover it before
           the cyber-criminals "spend" them, you may get them back. Read more about BTC calculation
           `here <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses>`_.

        This is the first key to try to recover.

    AES private key(s) (other names: *AES-session-key*, ``aes_prv``):
        A new such key is randomly generated whenever an infected PC boots.
        Your files are encrypted with this number using `AES symmetric method
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard>`_.
        It is "symmetrical" in the sense that the same number also decrypts your files.
        This is you 2nd chance, assuming the *BTC private key* above is too long.


EC *Public* keys (other names: ``btc_pub``, ``aes_pub``):
    There are 2 *EC public point* keys, one for each corresponding *EC private key*, above.
    They are needed during regular decryption to derive the next key-type, the *shared secrets*.
    They are both stored in the header of your encrypted-files.


ECDH Shared *Secrets* (other names: *shared-key*, ``btc_sec``, ``aes_sec``):
    During regular encryption & decryption these 2 keys are temporarily calculated
    according to the *EC Diffie–Hellman* key-exchange protocol: by EC-multiplying
    one *public* key (i.e. BTC) with the opposite *private* one (i.e. AES),
    or vice-versa, since both operations arrive to the same *shared-secret*.
    In the Teslacrypt case, the *private-key* is *SHA256-hashed* first.
    They allow to derive the *AES* key from the *BTC*.
    They are not stored anywhere in your computer.

 *Multiplicative* keys(other names: *"mul"*, ``btc_mul``, ``aes_mul``):
    These 2 keys are the factorization targets; when factorized, the *private-keys*
    are easily derived, since::

      mul := secret * private

    The "weakness" lies in their size (just 128bits)
    They are both stored in the header of your encrypted-files.


How it works?
-------------
We recapitulate `how TeslaCrypt ransomware \< v3.0 works to explain the weakness
<https://securelist.com/blog/research/71371/teslacrypt-2-0-disguised-as-cryptowall/>`_
that is relevant for this cracking tool:

1. *TeslaCrypt* creates 2 random **AES** and **BTC** private keys - the AES will
   symmetrically[1]_ encrypt your files, the BTC will accept your money - and
   immediately transmits them to the operators of the ransomware (irrelevant here);

2. an "improvised" asymmetrical EC scheme is then used to to encrypt these AES & BTC keys
   within your computer; for redundancy (in case some of the keys are lost during transmission)
   they crypto-criminals employed an additional "big" multiplicative ciphetext (``XXX_mul_key``)
   which unfortunately for them, is not big enough(!).

3. it then starts to encrypt your files one-by-one, attaching these 2 fields
   into the headers of those files.

   Multiple *AES* keys will be generated if you interrupt the ransomware while it encrypts
   your files (i.e. reboot), but only a single *btc* pair is ever created.

*TeslaCrack* implements (primarily) an integer factorization attack against
the ``aes_mul_key`` and ``btc_mul_key`` fields, recovering the original AES-key by just
trying all factor combinations, and using some method for validating that the
tested-key is the correct one (e.g. ECDH schema, BTC address validation).

Additionally it can derive the *AES private key* from the *BTC private key*.

The actual factorization is not implemented within *TeslaCrack* - it only extracts
the numbers to be factored, and you have to feed them into 3rd party factoring tools,
such as `YAFU or msieve
<https://www.google.com/search?q=msieve+factorization>`_.


Installation
============

You need a working Python 2.7 or Python-3.4+ environment,
**preferably 64-bit** (if supported by your OS).
A 32-bit Python can also work, but it will be significantly slower

Install Python
--------------
In *Windows*, the following 1 + 2 alternative have been tested:

- The `"official" distributions <https://www.python.org>`_, which **require
  admin-rights to install and to ``pip``-install the necessary packages.**
  Note the official site by default may offer you a 32-bit version -
  choose explicitly the 64-bit version.
  Check also the option for adding Python into your ``PATH``.

- The portable `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io>`_ distributions.
  It has been tested both with: `WinPython-3.4 "slim"
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.4/3.4.3.7/>`_
  and `WinPython-2.7 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_2.7/2.7.10.3/>`_.
  Notice that by default they do not modify your ``PATH`` so you
  **must run all commands from the included command-prompt executable**.
  And although  they **do not require admin-rights to install**,
  you most probably **need admin-rights** when running ``teslacrack decrypt``,
  if the files to decrypt originate from a different user.


Install TeslaCrack
------------------
1. At a command-prompt with python enabled (and with admin-rights in the "official" distribution),
   do one of the following:

   - Install it directly from the PyPi repository::

        pip install teslacrack

   - Or install it directly the latest version from GitHub::

        pip install git+https://github.com/Googulator/TeslaCrack.git

   - Or install the sources in "develop" mode, assuming you have already
     downloaded them in some folder::

        pip install -e <sources-folder>

   .. Warning::

        If you get an error like ``'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command ...``
        then you may execute the following Python-2 code and re-run the commands above::

            python -c "import urllib2; print urllib2.urlopen('https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py').read()" | python
            easy_install pip

        If you get native-compilation errors, make sure you have the latest
        your `pip` is upgraded to the latest version::

            python -m pip install -U pip

        In all cases, check that the command ``teslacrack`` has been installed
        in your path::

            teslacrack --version

2. In addition, you need a program for factoring large numbers.

   For this purpose, I recommend using Msieve (e.g. http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve/)
   and the ``factmsieve.py`` wrapper.
   Run the factorization on a fast computer, as it can take a lot of processing power.
   On a modern dual-core machine, most encrypted AES-keys can be factorized
   in a few hours, with some unlucky keys possibly taking up to a week.


How to decrypt your files
=========================

1. Check if this tool can crack you *TeslaCrypt* version:
---------------------------------------------------------
Check that the extension of your crypted files belongs to the known ones (i.e.
``.vvv, .ccc, .zzz, .aaa, .abc``); if your extension is missing, edit
``teslacrack/decrypt.py`` and append it into ``tesla_extensions`` string-list.
For al list of all extensions, read `TeslaCrypt versions`_ at the bottom.

.. Note::

     The extensions ``.ttt, .xxx, .micro`` and ``.mp3``(!) have been
     reported for the new variant of TeslaCrypt >= v3.0, which this tool cannot
     decrypt.


2. Decide which Key to attack:  *BTC* or *AES*?
-----------------------------------------------
You should definitely attempt to factorize your *"mul" BTC* key - but you may be unlucky
and it may be too long. So if you count how many different *"mul"* AES-keys have encrypted
your files, you will know better your road ahead.

.. Tip::

     To understand the various names of keys mentioned in these instructions,
     read the Terminology`_ section.

To gather all "mul" keys, attempt to decrypt your files and check the output
of this command::

    teslacrack ls <folder-to-your-crypted-files>

This command will print and update the internal *key-db* with all unknown encryption keys
encountered.

If you get a multiple unknown ``aes_mul_key``, better use the ``unfactor`` sub-cmd
on the ``btc_mul_key`` using one of ``--ecdh`` and ``--btc-addr <addr>`` options;
otherwise, you have an additional option to use the plain ``unfactor`` sub-cmd
directly on the ``aes_mul_key``, which is slightly faster.  But in any case,
the time-consuming step is no 3, "factorization", not the key-reconstruction.


3. Factorize your "mul" Key:
----------------------------
Factorize the "mul" keys or any composite-factors discovered from `factordb.com
<http://factordb.com/>`_ (those marked as "CF"). If you are lucky, your key may
have been already factorized, and you can skip the next step :-)

- Use one of the *external* factorization programs.
  For instance, using *msieve*::

     msieve -v -e <encrypted-key>

- If your key is in hexadecimal form (as printed by ``decrypt``), prepend it
  with a ``0x`` prefix.

- The ``-e`` switch is needed to do a "deep" elliptic curve search,
  which speeds up *msieve* for numbers with many factors (by default,
  *msieve* is optimized for semi-primes such as RSA moduli)

- To convert a key to decimal, e.g. the hex value ``'ae1b015a'``, in Python use
  ``int('ae1b015a', 16)``.
  Alternatively you may view all keys contained in a tesla-file converted as integers
  with this command::

     teslacrack ls <your-tesla-file> -Cnum

- You may use *YAFU*, which is multithreaded, but tends to crash often
  (at least for me).  Just make sure you use the ``-threads`` option.

- For numbers with few factors (where ``-e`` is ineffective, and *msieve/YAFU*
  run slow), use ``factmsieve.py`` (downloaded optionally above), which is
  more complicated, but also faster, multithreaded, and doesn't tend to crash.

- This step might take considerable time - days is not uncommon.


4. Reconstruct your Key:
------------------------
- Assuming you found a single unknown ``aes_mul_key`` key, you may choose
  the default key-reconstructor which is bit faster - but you must choose a file
  with known magic-bytes in its header:

  - *pdf* & *word-doc* files,
  - images and sounds (*jpg, png, gif, mp3*), and
  - archive formats: *gzip, bz2, 7z, rar* and of course *zip*, which includes
    all LibreOffice and newer Microsoft *docs/xlsx* & *ODF* documents.

  .. Tip::

       To view or extend the supported file-types, edit ``teslacrack/unfactor.py``
       and append a new mapping into ``known_file_magics`` dictionary.
       Note that in *python-3*, bytes are given like that: ``b'\xff\xd8'``.

  Add the primes from previous step, separated by spaces, into this command::

       teslacrack unfactor <crypted-file>  <factor-1>  <factor-2> ...

  It will reconstruct and print any decrypted AES-keys candidates (usually just one).

- Alternatively you may use ``--ecdh`` option to break either the AES or the
  BTC key for the |TeslaDecoder|_ tool (see section below).  This option requires
  AES or BTC public keys, which you may get them  also with the ``file`` sub-cmd
  (see previous step on how)::

       teslacrack unfactor --ecdh <crypted-file>  <factor-1>  <factor-2> ...

  Which key to break (BTC or AES) gets to be deduced from the factors you provide.

- A 3rd reconstructor is based on *Bitcoin-addresses* and is enacted with the
  ``--btc-addr`` option - read `Break bitcoin-keys for TeslaDecoder`_ section
  below for this.

- As utility, the ``unfactor`` sub-command provides for reconstructing a key
  without the tesla-file that originated from::

      teslacrack unfactor --pub <pub-key> <mul-key> <prime-factors>...

  Notice that it requires both types of keys:
  - the ECDH-public AES or BTC key with the ``--ecdh`` option, and
  - the paired "mul" key as its 1st positional argument, before adding the usual
    prime-factors.


5. Register and Test the reconstructed AES key:
-----------------------------------------------
Assuming above you reconstructed your AES key, you may now edit ``teslacrack.py``
and add a new key-pair into the ``known_AES_key_pairs`` dictionary, like that::

    <encrypted-AES-key>: <1st decrypted-AES-key candidate>,

The program accepts hex, integer, base64 or bytes.

To test it, repeat the command from step 2. A decrypted file should now appear
next to the crypted one (``.vvv`` or ``.ccc``, etc) - verify that the contents
of the decrypted-file do make sense.


6. Decrypt all your files:
--------------------------
To decrypt all of your files run from an administrator command prompt::

    teslacrack decrypt --progress D:\

- In some cases you may start receiving error-messages, saying
  ``"Unknown key in file: some/file"``.
  This means that some of your files have been crypted with different
  AES-keys (i.e. the ransomware had been restarted due to a reboot).
  ``teslacrack decrypt`` will print at the end any new encrypted AES-key(s)
  encountered - repeat the procedure from step 4 for all newly discovered
  key(s) :-(

- ``decrypt`` sub-command accepts an optional ``--delete`` and ``--delete-old``
  parameters, which will delete the crypted-files of any cleartext file it
  successfully generates (or already has generated, for the 2nd option).
  Before using this option, make sure that your files have been indeed
  decrypted correctly!

- By skipping this time the ``-v`` option (verbose logging) you avoid listing
  every file being visited - only failures and totals are reported.

- Use ``--overwrite`` or the more "selective" ``--fix`` option to
  re-generate all cleartext files or just those that had previously failed to
  decrypt, respectively.  They both accept an optional *file-extension*
  to construct the backup filename.
  Note that by default ``--overwrite`` does not make backups, while the
  ``-fix`` option, does.

- If you are going to decrypt 1000s of file (i.e ``D:\``), it's worth
  using the ``--precount`` option; it will consume some initial time to
  pre-calculate directories to be visited, and then a progress-indicator
  will be printed while decrypting.

- Finally, You can "dry-run" all of the above (decrypting, deletion and backup)
  with the ``-n`` option.


Break bitcoin-keys for *TeslaDecoder*
-------------------------------------

The |TeslaDecoder|_ can decrypt files from all(?) versions, assuming you
have the *bitcoin private-key*.
For very old TeslaCrypt versions (i.e. file-extensions ``ECC, .EXX, or .EZZ``)
*TeslaDecoder* could also extract this BTC private-key.  For later versions, you
have to manually factorize the BTC public-key reported by ``ls`` in step 2,
above, and feed its primes into the ``unfactor`` sub-cmds.

This 2nd form of the ``unfactor`` sub-cmd requires the *Bitcoin ransom address*,
as reported on the "ransom note", or obtained from:

- For very old v0.x.x TeslaCrypt versions, get it `from the recovery
  '.dat. file <http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/teslacrypt-alphacrypt-ransomware-information#versions>`_,
  found in the affected machine's ``%AppData%`` folder; the Bitcoin-address is
  the first line.
- For v2 infections, get it `from the registry
  <https://securelist.com/blog/research/71371/teslacrypt-2-0-disguised-as-cryptowall/#key-data-saved-in-the-system>`_.

.. Note::

   The ``teslacrack decrypt`` can't decode the files encryoted with very old
   TeslaCrypt versions, so you must perform the actual decryption with
   *TeslaDecoder*.

Example:
~~~~~~~~
.. Hint::

    The ``^`` char at the end of each line is the line-continuation characters
    on ``cmd.exe``/DOS.  The respective char in Linux is ```\``.

- To reconstruct a BTC priv-key from a tesla-file::

    > teslacrack unfactor <tesla-file>  ^
         --btc 1GSswEGHysnASUwNEKNjWXCW9vRCy57qA4 ^
         2 2 3 7 11 17 19 139 2311 14278309 465056119273 250220277466967 373463829010805159059 ^
         1261349708817837740609 38505609642285116603442307097561327764453851349351841755789120180499


- To reconstruct the same BTC priv-key in isolation in 2 steps::

    > teslacrack ls <tesla-file>  --fld=btc_pub --fld=btc_mul -Casc
    { 'file': 'tests/teslafiles/tesla_key33.docx.vvv',
      'btc_pub_key': 'th707a7P3jehYkYuW0IIb3KZto5gBHRb96R8VM5xQLa4mIHOkZXUAj0fp0unm5wVNPIXhbPi+gdW6IF4UZjkNA==',
      'btc_mul_key': 'Jvh8Yz8fK8eiQR8t8OHaDyrA/Zc81WyyhzB1FBLVgGqkL8iRBzZ0uniTd0ESb7d4yk5XgGN0MRgHOXr3rf9bTg=='}

  Notice that keys are printed in *base64* due to the ``-Casc`` option.
  You may now use 2 methods:

  1. ECDSA::

        > teslacrack unfactor --pub F3peCXPqNP+uuourpviPTtFNOUNVnXsWPdrI1N/p5aiS2ShtvbVvXY7RZoXVVk9i+v1EH360DsYq9z4Hc9dusQ==  ^

             2 2 3 7 11 17 19 139 2311 14278309 465056119273 250220277466967 373463829010805159059 ^
             1261349708817837740609 38505609642285116603442307097561327764453851349351841755789120180499

  2. BTC-address - you need to find the BTC-adrress from your "ransom-note"::

        > teslacrack unfactor --btc-addr 1GSswEGHysnASUwNEKNjWXCW9vRCy57qA4  ^
             BEPD/gJGBX0GNtDKu32O6YQ35ubA/jJKI+4aT9jFHbwG2S5t5TFAsFfFGFDhDXLFos4JgYB11BLx2rdynuTWJv4=  ^
             2 2 3 7 11 17 19 139 2311 14278309 465056119273 250220277466967 373463829010805159059  ^
             1261349708817837740609 38505609642285116603442307097561327764453851349351841755789120180499
